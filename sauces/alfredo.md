# (Easier) Alfredo Sauce

[Original Recipe](https://youtu.be/AFT1BkbEtfc)

This recipe comes from Adam Ragusea's recipe for White-sauced pizza. The sauce is stupidly-simple, and very tasty.
Works very well for an alfredo sauce.

The instructions are simple: melt some butter, golden some garlic, boil some cream, add cheese. 

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1 full garlic clove
* Fresh parmesan cheese
* 1 tbspn butter

## Cooking Instructions

* Prepare your ingredients: dice up garlic clove into a pile. Grate cheese into similarly-sized pile.
* Melt butter in a skillet (Not a Sauce Pan!) on medium heat.
* Brown your diced garlic to where it becomes golden.
* Add cream, allow it to come to a boil. (Might need to increase heat).
* Remove from heat, and wait until the bubbles have _mostly_ stopped.
* Mix in your cheese
* `optional` add ground pepper. No salt is needed, as the cheese should be salty enough.

If you leave your sauce for too long and it reduces too much or thickens, just add more cream & a little bit of heat.
