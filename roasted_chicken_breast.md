# Cast Iron SKillet Roasted Chicken Breast with Carrots & Potatoes

This is a favorite of mine on a late night.

The ingredients aren't super unlikely to be sitting around in your kitchen, and it doesn't require much effort to whip together.

Although it does take some time to cook, the payoff is worth it.

## Ingredients

- 2 Slices of Bacon
- 1 Whole Chicken Breast
- 1/4 Cup flour
- 1 Tbsp Herbs de Provence (or more for taste)
- 1 Cup Chicken Broth
- 1-2 Whole Carrots
- 1 Potato (Idaho or Russet)
- Salt & Pepper

## Instruction

1. Preheat oven to 350F

2. Mix flour & Herbs de Provence on plate

3. Dredge both sides of chicken in flour mixture and set aside

4. Over medium heat with a large cast iron pan, saute bacon until crispy

5. Remove bacon from skillet and transfer to paper towel to dry off

6. Place dredged chicken into cast-iron skillet and brown each side in bacon grease until golden brown.
   Don't worry about cooking the breast completely at this point, just accomplish a good browning.

7. Remove chicken from pan.

8. Add 1~2 tablespoons of leftover flour from chicken dredge to pan.
   (Add more flour for a thicker sauce mixture)

9. Add white wine & chicken broth to pan & scrape up bits at the bottom of the pan.
   Simmer this mixture until it begins to slightly thicken.

10. Return chicken breast & bacon to skillet, along with diced carrots & cubed potato.

11. Season with salt & pepper

12. Cover & place in oven for 40 minutes
