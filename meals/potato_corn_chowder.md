Corn & Potato Chowder (with a Touch of Lemon)

Serves: 4–6
Prep Time: 10 min
Cook Time: 30–40 min
Ingredients:

- 2 tbsp (28g) butter or olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced (~150g)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and diced (~400–450g)
- 450g frozen sweet corn (about 3 cups)
- 950ml chicken or vegetable broth (4 cups)
- 240g heavy cream (1 cup) (or milk/half-and-half)
- 1–2 tbsp lemon juice (to taste)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Optional: 1/2 tsp smoked paprika or thyme
- Optional: 1/4–1/2 tsp MSG (adds umami depth)

Instructions:

- **Sauté:**
  - In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook 5–7 minutes until soft and lightly golden. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
- **Simmer:**
  - Add diced potatoes, corn, and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 15–20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
- **Creamy Finish:**
  - Stir in the cream. Simmer gently (don’t boil) for another 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, salt, pepper, and MSG (if using). Taste and adjust seasoning.
- **Optional Texture Boost:**
  - For a thicker chowder, mash a few potatoes in the pot or blend a portion with an immersion blender.
- **Serve:**
  - Ladle into bowls. Top with cracked pepper, shredded cheese, herbs, or crumbled bacon if desired.
