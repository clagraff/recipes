## Cooking Instructions
### Chicken Prep
The chicken works best when pulled; either via boiling or using an instapot. I _highly_ recommend using an instapot.

* Dice the onion and carrots.
* Saute the veggies over medium-high heat until carrots are tender and onions are translucent.
* Add rice and broth to large pot, add veggies.
* Bring to boil, then reduce heat and let simmer unti rice is tender (15min).
* Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and lemon juice together.
* Slowly mix and pour the egg/lemon juice mixture into the pot after rice is done.
* Seaon with salt, pepper, and dill as desired.
