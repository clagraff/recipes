# Chicken Lemon Chicken Soup
A easy, low-effort soup of chicken and veggies, with lemon.
Goes great with Orzo.

The tl;dr is: Cook your chicken, cook your veggies, combine in pot, add water/broth, cook. Season and serve with Orzo.


## Ingredients
* Veggies
  * 1 bunch of carrots
  * 1 bunch of celery
  * 1 white onion
  * Optionally, 1 jalapeno
  * 1 dill bunch
* 1.5 lbs of chicken breast, or more/less as desired
* 1 qrt cream / heavy cream
* 1 lbs Orzo pasta
* Optionally, 1 box of chicken stock

## Cooking Instructions
**üêîChicken Prep**
The chicken works best when pulled; either via boiling or using an instapot, pulling apart with forks.
I _highly_ recommend using an instapot. Save the water from the boiling or instapot to use in the soup.

* Start cooking your chicken:
  * Place chicken breast in Instapot, cover with water.
  * Turn on, choose "Chicken" setting on Instapot.
  * Once Instapot is done, leave for 10min to do natural release, before depressuring.
  * Using forks, pull apart chicken. Save water to add to soup later.
* While chicken cooks, prep your veggies:
  * Dice your onion into small bite-sized pieces.
  * Dice an equal amount of both carrots and celery to match the amount of onion you have.
  * Optionally, slice jalapeno in half, use a spoon to remove seeds, then dice into small bite-sized chunks.
  * Thinly dice fresh dill, around 1tbsp worth, set aside for end.
* Cooking pot
  * In a dutch oven, add 1 tbpsn olive oil, heat on medium heat.
  * Once pot and oil is warm, add veggies. Stir occasionally for about 10min, when veggies are bright and colorful.
  * Add in the pulled chicken breast, the instapot/boiled water, and fill the remainder of the pot with chicken brother or water.
  * Bring to boil.
  * Reduce heat to low, cover for 20min.
* Cook Orzo in separate pot according to instructions.
* Once soup is done, season to taste:
  * Thicken soup using cream to desired flavor and texture.
  * Add lemon juice as desired. I find you need WAY more than you'd expect.
  * Add diced dill, as desired.
  * Add salt, pepper, msg as desired.

Serve in bowl with a scoup of Orzo.
