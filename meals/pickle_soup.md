## Instructions

1. **Sauté Aromatics**  
   In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and grated carrots. Cook for 5–7 minutes, until softened and fragrant.

2. **Simmer the Soup**  
   Add the diced potatoes and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender.

3. **Add Pickles**  
   Stir in the grated or chopped pickles and 1–2 tablespoons of pickle brine. Simmer for another 5–10 minutes. Taste and adjust brine for more tang if needed.

4. **Make Cream Mixture**  
   In a bowl, whisk together the sour cream and flour until smooth. Add a ladle of hot soup broth to temper the mixture, whisking constantly.

5. **Finish the Soup**  
   Lower the heat and stir in the sour cream mixture. Simmer gently for a few minutes to thicken (do not boil).

6. **Season and Serve**  
   Add salt, pepper, and optional herbs or spices to taste. Garnish with fresh dill if desired and serve hot.

## Notes

- If you don’t have sour cream, use 1/2 cup heavy cream and a splash of lemon juice or extra pickle brine for tang.
- Avoid boiling after adding cream to prevent curdling.
- For a vegetarian version, use veggie broth and skip seafood seasonings.
