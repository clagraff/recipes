# Roasted Rosemary Potatoes

[Original Recipe](https://youtu.be/gjoMc7w00e0)

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup water
* 1/8 teaspoon yeast
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 1 cup bread flour (you can use all-purpose, but you'll probably need a little more, since it absorbs less water)


## Preparation

* Mix ingredients in a small glass container until they just come together.
  * The dough should be just barely wet enough to have no visible dry patches.
  * Add more water or flour if necessary.
* Cover and either rise on the counter for a few hours until about doubled in size and then **refrigerate (at least overnight), or put it straight into the refrigerator for a week.**

## Cooking Instructions

* Prepare a parchment-lined baking sheet.
* Wet your hands and stretch the cold dough into a snake the length of the pan diagonally.
* Lay the dough on the parchment diagonally and let it stick.
* Spray the top with water to keep it from drying out, and let rise for about **an hour until puffy**.
* Bake at 500 F, spraying frequently (at least for the first 10 minutes, until fully puffed up), until dark amber and done, 20-25 minutes.
