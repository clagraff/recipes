# Pumpkin Bread Loaf

[Original Recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/spiced-pumpkin-bread.html)

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1-1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 15-oz can 100% pure pumpkin (I use Libby's)


## Preparation

* Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
* Leave the baking pans/tins in the oven as it pre-heats


### Cooking Instructions
* Combine flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, & nutmeg in a medium bowl.
* Whisk all the dry ingredients together.
* In a separate bowl, beat/mix together sugar and room-temperature butter until blended.
* Mix in one egg at a time. Beat until very light & fluffy, usually a few minutes.
* Beat in the pumpkin.
* Pour in the flour mixture & mix on **low** speed until combined.


**Bonus tip:** While the bread is still hot, or after reheating a slice for `30s` in a microwave, cover with a line or two of honey. It is delicious!
