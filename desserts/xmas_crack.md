## Ingredients:
- 1 sleeve saltine crackers
- 1 cup butter
- 1 cup brown sugar (or white sugar and maple syrup)
- 12oz bag of chocolate chips
- Chopped nuts of choice, walnuts 

## Cooking
- Line a large baking sheet with foil
- Lay saltines flat, in one single layer, over the foil.
- Depending on sheet size, either wrap the foil around the sheet or wrap it upwards. The goal is to create a barrier so goop cant flow over.
- In saucepan, add 1cup butter and 1cup brown sugar. Bring to boil, and keep boiling for 5 minutes.
- Pour over the crackers as evenly as possible. Can use a plastic baking spatula to spread it around.
- Place in over at 350-degrees for 7 minutes.
- Top with entire 12oz bag of chocolate chips (or equivallent chocolate), as evenly as possible.
- Spread the chocolate chips, they should quickly melt and be easy to cover over the dessert.
- Optionally top with nuts, M&Ms, sprinkles, other candies, etc.
- Refrigerate.
